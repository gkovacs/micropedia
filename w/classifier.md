A classifier is a type of [learning algorithm](machine-learning) which assigns one or more [labels](labels) to a given input. For example, an algorithm that predicts whether a tumor is malignant or benign (the labels), given the size of the tumor (the input), is a classifier.

Types of classification problems:

* Single-class classification: where we assign a single [label](labels) to an example
* Multi-class classification: where we assign multiple [labels](labels) to an example
