Training data is a set of training examples that is used by a [supervised](supervised-learning) [learning algorithm](machine-learning) for training a [hypothesis function](hypothesis-function). For example, if you were training a [regression algorithm](regression-algorithm) that [predicts the price of a house given its area](regression-example), your training examples would be a set of prices and areas of houses.
