This is an [example](regression-example) of using [supervised learning](supervised-learning) to solve a [regression problem](regression-algorithm).

Given the living areas and prices of houses ([training data](training-data)), predict the price of a new house (given its area).

Suppose we have a dataset giving the living areas and prices of houses from Portland, Oregon. We plot the data:

![(regression-example-fig1](png/regression-example-fig1)

Then draw a line through it:

![regression-example-fig2](png/regression-example-fig2)

Now we can predict that the size of a 750 ft2 house is is around $150k.

![regression-example-fig3](png/regression-example-fig3)

This is called [linear regression](linear-regression) because we drew a straight line. However, we can also draw other shapes like quadratic curves (quadratic regression).
