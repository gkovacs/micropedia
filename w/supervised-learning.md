Supervised learning is a type of [learning algorithm](machine-learning) where the computer is presented with example inputs and outputs ([training data](training-data)) in advance. The goal is to learn a function (the [hypothesis function](hypothesis-function)) that predicts the output, given an input.

Types of supervised learning:

* [regression](regression-algorithm): predicting a continuous value for examples
* [classification](classifier): predicting [labels](label) for examples
