A regression algorithm is a type of [learning algorithm](machine-learning) that predicts a continuous variable. For example, an algorithm that predicts the price of a house (the output, which is a continuous variable), given its area (the input), would be a regression algorithm.

Types of regression problems:

* [Linear regression](linear-regression)
* Polynomial regression

[Example of regression](regression-example)
