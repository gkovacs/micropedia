Multiplication multiplies numbers together. It is repeated [addition](addition): multiplying 5 times 3 is the same as adding 3 fives together. So 5*3 = 5+5+5.

The times (*) sign is used to represent multiplication.

For example, if you want to know what value is 5 times 3, you can multiply 5 and 3, which equals 15. We can write this as 5 * 3 = 15.

A [multiplication table](multiplication-table) lists multiplication results for small numbers.
