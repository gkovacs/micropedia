A multiplication table lists the results of [multiplying](multiplication) numbers. It is a matrix where the entry at the (x,y) coordinate equals x * y. So if you want to know what 5*3 equals, you look at the entry at row 5 and column 3, and see it's 15. Because 5 * 3 = 3 * 5 (multiplication is communitative), this is the same as the entry at row 3 and column 5.
