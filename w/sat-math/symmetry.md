Symmetry is a property of certain [geometric](geometry) [shapes](shapes) where the halves are identical when you split them according to a line.

There are various types of symmetry:

* Symmetry along the x-axis
* Symmetry along the y-axis
* Radial symmetry

Things that are not symmetric are asymmetric.
