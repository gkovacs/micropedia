You are running a company and want to develop [learning algorithms](machine-learning) to address each of two problems:

Problem 1: You have a large inventory of identical items. You want to predict how many of these items will sell over the next 3 months

Problem 2: You'd like software to examine individual customer accounts and for each account decide if it has been hacked/compromised

Should you treat these as [classification](classifier) or [regression](regression-algorithm) problems?

* Treat both as classification problems
* Treat problem 1 as a classification problem and problem 2 as a regression problem
* Treat problem 1 as a regression problem and problem 2 as a classification problem
* Treat both as regression problems
