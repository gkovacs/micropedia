The pronouns in spanish are:

Yo = I

[Tu](tu) = you

Vos = you (used instead of tu in certain countries)

El = he

Ella = she

Nosotros = we

Ellos = they (male)

Ellas = they (female)

Ustedes = you all (latin american usage)

Vosotros = you all (spain usage)

Spanish conjugation changes the form of verbs in response to the pronoun. Pronouns can often be omitted.
