X denotes the space of input values of a [learning algorithm](machine-learning)

Y denotes the space of output values of a learning algorithm

x(i) denotes the input variables, or input features

y(i) denotes the output or target variable

Note that the superscript "(i)"" in the notation is simply an index into the training set, and has nothing to do with exponentiation
