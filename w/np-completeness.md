NP-complete problems are problems that are hard for computers to solve

[Summary](np-completeness-summary): NP-complete problems are hard for computers to solve

[Formal Definition](np-completeness-definition): NP-complete problems are NP-hard and in NP

[Implications](np-completeness-implications): If a problem is NP-complete, an approximate solution is often the best you can hope for

[Examples](np-completeness-examples): 3SAT, Knapsack, Vertex Cover, etc

[Proving NP completeness](np-completeness-proofs): If your problem can solve an existing NP-hard problem, it's NP-hard
