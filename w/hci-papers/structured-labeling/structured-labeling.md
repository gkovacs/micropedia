Structured Labeling to Facilitate Concept Evolution in Machine Learning

What are the main contributions of this paper?

Two tools to perform structured labeling, a novel technique for helping people define and refine their concept in a consistent manner as they label.

Five experiments to show that structured labeling helps people label more consistently in the presence of [concept evolution](concept-evolution) than traditional labeling.
