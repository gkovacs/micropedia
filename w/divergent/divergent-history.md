[Divergent](divergent) > History

In a post-apocalyptic Chicago, survivors were divided into [five factions](divergent-factions) based on their dispositions.

Each year, all sixteen-year-olds must take an [aptitude test](divergent-aptitude-test) that describes the one faction for which they are best suited.

After receiving the results, they can decide whether to remain with their family's faction or transfer to a new faction.

Those who do not complete initiation into their new faction become [Factionless](divergent-factionless), and are forced to live in poverty on the streets of the city.
