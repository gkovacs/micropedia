The hypothesis function is a function h : [X](ml-notation1) -> [Y](ml-notation1) so that h(x) is a "good" predictor for the corresponding value of y. The objective of a [supervised](supervised-learning) [learning algorithm](machine-learning) is to learn the hypothesis function from a [training set](training-data).
