Gradient descent is used in [linear regression](linear-regression) to find a set of parameters θ that minimizes the [cost function](cost-function) J(θ). It starts with an initial guess for the parameters θ1 and repeatedly changes using the [update function](update-function) until we converge at a value of θ that minimizes J(θ).
