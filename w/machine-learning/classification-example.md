This is an [example](supervised-example) of using [supervised learning](supervised-learning) to solve a [classification problem](classifier).

Given the sizes of tumors and whether they are malignant or benign ([training data](training-data)), predict whether they are malignant or benign (the [label](labels) of the tumor).

We plot the data:

![classification-example-fig1](png/classification-example-fig1)

Now we try to draw a line that will split the data. Unfortunately we can't. [We need another feature - age](classification-example-part2).
