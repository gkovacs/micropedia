This is an [example](supervised-example) of using [supervised learning](supervised-learning) to solve a [classification problem](classifier).

Given the sizes and ages of tumors and whether they are malignant or benign ([training data](training-data)), predict whether they are malignant or benign (the [label](labels) of the tumor).

We plot the data (X = malignant, O = benign):

![(classification-example-fig2](png/classification-example-fig2)

Now we can draw a line through it that splits malignant tumors from benign tumors:

![(classification-example-fig3](png/classification-example-fig3)

Now we can predict that since the tumor we're trying to classify falls below the line, it's benign:

![(classification-example-fig4](png/classification-example-fig4)
