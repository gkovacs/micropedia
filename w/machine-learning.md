Machine learning gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

Machine learning tasks can be divided into three categories, depending on the type of learning "signal" or "feedback" available:

* [supervised learning](supervised-learning): where we give the algorithm some labeled examples ([training data](training-data)) in advance
* unsupervised learning: where the algorithm is not given training data in advance
* reinforcement learning: where we give the algorithm a goal to optimize and a reward function

Machine learning tasks can also be classified according to the desired output of the system:

* [regression](regression-algorithm): predicting a continuous value for examples
* [classification](classifier): predicting [labels](labels) for examples
* clustering: grouping examples together into clusters
* density estimation: estimating an underlying probability density function from data
* dimensionality reduction: reducing the number of dimensions (features) in your data
